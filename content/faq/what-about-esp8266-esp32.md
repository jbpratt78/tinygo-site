As of February 2019 there is now an official project from Espressif to add the Xtensa chip architecture to LLVM.

For the discussion of this see [this forum thread](https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=9226).

The repository that contains the Xtensa fork of LLVM is located at [https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project](https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project)

It is not yet in a usable state, but once it is we will start the process of supporting it in TinyGo.
